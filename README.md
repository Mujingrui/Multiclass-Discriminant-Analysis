# Multiclass-Discriminant-Analysis
Mai, Yang and Zou proposed a new method for high-dimensional classification and variable selection in 2015. In our project, we simulated 
the data as the paper suggested and applied the method on the IBD dataset and simulated dataset. And we also compare the method with l1 
penalized Fisher's method.
